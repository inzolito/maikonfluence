                    <p style="">When we write user stories, they can be broad and that is Ok! These user stories should be broken down into smaller and workable chunks by the team when it makes sense.</p><p style="">Splitting user stories is an important part of the work done by an agile team. Leaving a user story too big makes it difficult for it to be completed faster. Working on smaller user stories helps teams to get a faster feedback loop, as they can be completed faster, the product owner, stakeholders and customers can test and give feedback as soon as possible, which will help the team easily improve and correct things quicker.</p><h2 style="" id="HowtoSliceaUserstory-Howcanwesliceauserstory?"><strong>How can we slice a user story?</strong></h2><p style=""><strong>Horizontal Vs Vertical Slicing</strong></p><p style="">Rather than giving a customer or an end-user one layer of a cake each time (as seen in the Horizontal slicing above i.e., User interface layer done in Sp 1) in which case the client only gets to taste one particular layer at a time, In agile, we want to give the end-user a tiny piece of the whole cake hence the name Vertical Slicing (As seen in the picture above - SP 1- Subject).</p><p style="">In a horizontal slicing, the end-user will only get the chance to experience the system only when it is fully done. For example, we create the first the Database Layer, then the security layer, then the middle tier and finally the UI layer however in a vertical slicing, the idea is to build the system user story by user story where each story will cross all horizontal layers.</p><p style="">With the horizontal slicing, the feedback loop is long which significantly increases the risk as the entire cake must be fully baked before the customer realizes that the cake, he got is not necessarily the one he wanted. Maybe the customer preferred vanilla flavor rather than chocolate in one of the layers, if he had the chance to taste one slice, he would have realized those gaps earlier on.</p><p style=""><br/></p><p style=""><strong>SPIDR method of slicing</strong></p><p style=""><br/></p><p style=""><strong><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-external-resource" draggable="false" height="400" src="https://info.itemis.com/hubfs/Blog/Usability/spider-technik-user-stories.png" data-image-src="https://info.itemis.com/hubfs/Blog/Usability/spider-technik-user-stories.png"></span></span></strong></p><p style="">The SPIDR method is one method we as a team can use to split our user stories.</p><p style=""><br/></p><ul style=""><li><strong>SPIKES-</strong><span> </span>This is a term used in agile software development. Spikes are used to prototype the implementation of a functionality and is typically used for the evaluation and feasibility of new technologies. When teams need to build the functionality using either an old technology or a new technology, we can create spikes. Spikes involve investigations and build in knowledge. </li></ul><p style="">Other techniques should first be used to split user stories into smaller sizes before thinking about a Spike. Spike should be used to split a user story only if the team didn't manage to use other methods to split the user story. Once there is better understanding of the user story and the technology to be used then we can work on splitting the initial user story using the other methods of SPIDR.</p><ul style=""><li><strong>PATHS</strong>- Consider the different paths. If there are several possible alternative paths in a user story, one option is to create separate user stories from some of these paths. Note: It is not absolutely necessary to write a user story for each individual path but just where it makes sense for example</li></ul><p style="">             <strong>Big User story: As a customer, I want to be able to pay for my goods online so that I do not have to transfer money</strong>.</p><p style="">This large story can be split by using the happy flow or Unhappy flow. The above large story can be broken down using these paths:</p><p style=""> <strong>Happy Flow</strong>- The happy flow describes how functionality behave when everything goes well.</p><p style="">             <strong>Small story: As a customer, I want to be able to have a validation screen so that I can have full information on my order.</strong></p><p style=""> <strong>Unhappy Flow</strong>- If there are any deviations, exceptions or other problems, the 2nd user story could then be.</p><p style="">            <strong><span> </span>Small story: As a customer, I want to be able to see an error screen so that I can have a proof if my account is debited. </strong></p><p style="">We don't have to implement the full system but only the part that shows that something went wrong. The above stories can still be further broken down in different other paths such as payment methods i.e.: PayPal or Credit Card. Credit card path can also even be broken down further i,e. User story focusing on Visa or Mastercard.</p><p style="">Let's break down &quot;<strong>As a customer, I want to be able to have a validation screen so that I can have full information on my order&quot;<span> </span></strong>further using the payment methods path:</p><p style="">   <span> </span><strong>Smaller story 1:<span> </span></strong>As a customer using Paypal, I want to be able to have a validation screen so that I can have full information on my order.</p><p style="">   <strong><span> </span>Smaller story 2:<span> </span></strong>As a customer using credit card, I want to be able to have a validation screen so that I can have full information on my order.</p><p style="">The above smaller stories can then be prioritized such that the &quot;Must have&quot; are ranked first and brought into the sprint to be Demo'd as an increment once the sprint ends i.e., Smaller US 1 can be brought in SP 1 and Smaller US 2 may not be worked on until US 3 depends on the priority as ranked by the PO.</p><p style="">Again, keep in mind that we should only split user stories only when it makes sense and when it is too big to fit in a sprint for example.</p><p style=""><br/></p><ul style=""><li><strong>INTERFACE</strong>- Most interface have to support various platforms like mobile phones, desktops and web applications. It may be beneficial to break down large items depending on the interface. For example:</li></ul><p style=""> <strong><span> </span> Mobile Application:<span> </span></strong>We can create user stories that relates exclusively to Android devices and then another user story on IOS devices. </p><p style="">   <strong>Desktop Application:</strong><span> </span>Stories can be split depending on the operating system. We can start with Windows 11, then Mac OS and then Linux</p><p style="">   <strong>Web Application:<span> </span></strong>We can split by which browser is supported first i.e., User story on Google Chrome, then Mozilla Firefox etc.</p><p style="">The user stories can be prioritized depending on the target group. We can start with User stories that will affect the maximum number of users before moving to the next ones.</p><p style=""><br/></p><ul style=""><li><strong>DATA</strong>- Some user stories can be split based on the datatypes they return, or the parameter they are supposed to be handled. Let's use the example of a creating a web page on banking platform where the user needs to fill some information such as </li></ul><p style=""><strong>Name </strong>- Should have text field.</p><p style=""><strong>Surname</strong><span> </span>- Should have text field.</p><p style=""><strong>Date of Birth</strong>- Should have a calendar.</p><p style=""><strong>City</strong>- Should have a list of cities to choose from</p><p style=""><strong>Maximum amount of money<span> </span></strong>- Should have a cursor to allow amount adjustment.</p><p style="">We can create 4 user stories using the data types as follows:</p><p style=""><strong>  User story 1:</strong><span> </span>Could be to create all as text fields such that the customer can still input all the information required as a text at first.</p><p style=""><strong>  User story 2: </strong><span> </span>We can add the possibility for users to be able to pick dates from a calendar.</p><p style=""><strong>  User story 3:</strong><span> </span>We can add the possibility for users to pick their choice of cities from a prepopulated list.</p><p style=""><strong>  User story 4:</strong><span> </span>We can create a cursor for the amounts needed.</p><p style="">Again, do not split a user story for the sake of splitting it but only when it makes sense and when it is needed. If all 4 can be done in 1 single story and can be small enough to be completed in 1 sprint, then there would be no need to split the user story.</p><p style=""><br/></p><ul style=""><li><strong>RULES-</strong><span> </span>User stories usually involve a number of explicit and implicit business rules. By studying these business rules, you might discover it is possible to break an item into smaller pieces of functionality. For example, if the user story is about setting a password: &quot;As a customer, i want to be able to set up my password so i can login securely&quot;.</li></ul><p style="">We could have the following rules for password creation:</p><ol style=""><li>Length 7 characters minimum</li><li>Minimum 2 special characters</li><li>Not the last 3 passwords</li><li>No use of the user's name</li></ol><p style="">With the above rules, it is fine if we decide not to implement the last 2 rules initially. We can allow the user to create a password with applying only the 1st two rules which can become our first user story and then the last 2 rules can be created later with another user story or even 1 user story per rule. The initial user story will be delivered in several smaller steps.</p><p style="">Splitting a user story by rule should be done only when it makes sense and when it is needed to make a user story smaller. </p><p style=""><br/></p><p style=""><strong>Acceptance Criteria method of slicing a user </strong><strong>story.</strong></p><p style="">The &quot;Splitting by Acceptance Criteria&quot; approach involves dividing user stories based on the specific conditions that must be met for the story to be considered complete or &quot;done.&quot; Each acceptance criterion represents a testable requirement that must be satisfied before the user story can be delivered to stakeholders.</p><p style="">For example, consider a user story: &quot;<strong>As a customer, I want to add products to my cart.&quot;</strong><span> </span>The acceptance criteria for this user story might include:</p><ul style=""><li>The product should be added to the cart when the &quot;Add to Cart&quot; button is clicked.</li><li>The cart icon should display the correct number of items after adding products.</li><li>The cart should be accessible from any page on the website.</li></ul><p style="">To split this user story by acceptance criteria, we can create separate user stories for each criterion, such as:</p><ul style=""><li>“As a customer, I want the product to be added to the cart when I click the 'Add to Cart' button.&quot;</li><li>&quot;As a customer, I want the cart icon to display the correct number of items after adding products.&quot;</li><li>&quot;As a customer, I want the cart to be accessible from any page on the website.&quot;</li></ul><p style=""><strong>ADDITIONAL RESOURCES</strong></p><p style="">User stories template and examples<span> </span><a href="https://confluence.hexagonmining.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=317040430" rel="nofollow" style="">User story, Task, Bug &amp; Epic Templates &amp; examples</a></p><p style="">Story point reference table<span> </span><a class="createlink" href="https://confluence.hexagonmining.com/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=MPNA&amp;title=Estimation+baseline+Vs+Story+point+reference+table&amp;linkCreation=true&amp;fromPageId=317040427" rel="nofollow" style="text-decoration: underline;">Estimation baseline Vs Story point reference table</a></p><p style="">Good acceptance criteria<span> </span><a href="https://confluence.hexagonmining.com/display/MPNA/How+to+write+a+good+acceptance+criteria" rel="nofollow" style="">How to write a good acceptance criteria</a></p>
